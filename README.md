Slay zombies get money and upgrade using dices.

Controls:
  -'Left Mouse' to shoot
  -'E' to interact and to throw a dice
  -'WASD' to move
  -'Escape' to pause


When you go to the shop you can choose up to 6 upgrades (more upgrades, more money) and then buy a dice that has these upgrades, 
the dice gives you one of them or nothing if you chose less than 6.

This game was originally made for the GMTK game jam.

I will also add some features and variety in the near future.
